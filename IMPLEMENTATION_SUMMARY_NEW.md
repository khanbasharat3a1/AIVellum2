   - **Watch Ad**: Unlock this prompt for free
3. User chooses option
4. After successful unlock, returns to prompt details (now unlocked)

### Startup Experience

2. Navigates to main screen
3. After 2 seconds, Pro promotion dialog appears (if 3+ days since last shown)
4. User can get Pro or dismiss

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run `flutter pub get` to install google_mobile_ads
- [ ] Test HTML stripping on prompts with markup
- [ ] Test navigation after prompt unlock
- [ ] Test banner ads loading on all screens
- [ ] Test rewarded ad flow for prompt unlocking
- [ ] Test Pro promotion dialog timing
- [ ] Test Play Store link opens correctly
- [ ] Verify all ad IDs are correct
- [ ] Test on real device (ads don't work in emulator)

## Next Steps

1. **Build and Test**: 
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   flutter build apk --release
   ```

2. **Upload to Play Console**: Update the free version

3. **Monitor**: Track ad performance and conversion to Pro

4. **Iterate**: Adjust ad frequency and Pro promotion based on metrics

## Notes

- Ads require real device testing (won't show in emulator)
- AdMob account must be properly configured
- Test ads will show until app is approved by AdMob
- Pro promotion dialog shows every 3 days to avoid being intrusive
- All subscription code remains but is hidden from UI (can be re-enabled if needed)
