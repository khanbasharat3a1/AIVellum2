## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Sign in with Google - shows loading, syncs data
- [ ] Purchase single prompt - unlocks and returns to detail
- [ ] Watch ad - unlocks and returns to detail
- [ ] Subscribe - unlocks all and returns to detail
- [ ] Sign out - clears data, shows loading
- [ ] Check profile - shows correct stats
- [ ] Check home screen - stats update in real-time
- [ ] Subscription expiry - auto-deactivates after 30 days

## Future Improvements

1. **Real-time Sync**: Use `getUserDataStream()` for live updates across devices
2. **Billing Integration**: Connect to Google Play Billing for auto-renew
