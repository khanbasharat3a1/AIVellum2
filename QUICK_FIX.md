## Google Sign-In Setup (Required)

The app works WITHOUT sign-in for:

Sign-in is ONLY needed for:
- Making purchases
- Syncing data

### To Fix Google Sign-In:

**Option 1: Get SHA-1 Manually**
```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore "%USERPROFILE%\.android\debug.keystore" -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
```

**Option 2: Use Android Studio**
1. Open android folder in Android Studio
2. Click Gradle tab (right side)
3. Navigate to: android > Tasks > android > signingReport
4. Double click to run
5. Copy SHA-1 from output

**Then:**
1. Go to Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/aivellum-3521b/settings/general
2. Click your Android app
3. Add the SHA-1 fingerprint
4. Download new google-services.json
5. Replace android/app/google-services.json
6. Run: `flutter clean && flutter run`

## Current Status

✅ App compiles and runs
✅ Ads configured
✅ Firestore working
✅ Watch ads without sign-in
✅ Profile screen added
⚠️ Google Sign-In needs SHA-1 setup

## Test Without Sign-In

You can test everything except purchases:

3. View unlocked content
4. See ads (banner/interstitial)

## Test With Sign-In (After SHA-1 Setup)

5. No ads after purchase
